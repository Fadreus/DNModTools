How to extract Dragon Nest:

Step 1: Download DNExtract.zip and extract it into a folder of your choice.

Step 2: Copy pasta your Resource00, Resource01, Resource02, and Resource03 files into this folder. You can find these files in "C:\Nexon\DragonNest" assuming you installed Dragon Nest to the default folder.

Step 3: Run quickbms.exe. When you do a command window should pop-up, then a window for you to select a file. In this first window select the file dragonnest.bms. 

Step 4: A new window should open asking for another file, this time select Resource00.pak. After hitting open the last window will pop up asking for the filename, this one doesn't matter really. Just put whatever you want.

Step 5: After a while it will extract all the files in Resource00 to new folders inside whatever folder you have all of this stuff in.

Step 6: Rinse and repeat for the rest of the Resource files and you're done.
